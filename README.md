## Pymaceuticals 

This notebook analyzes the data to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare after monitoring 250 mice that were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days.

* The analysis highlights the following: 
	* A scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.
	* A scatter plot that shows how the number of metastatic (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment.
	* A scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate)
	* A bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.
